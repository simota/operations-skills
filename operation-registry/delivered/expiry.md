- **Every undo, restore, runbook and escalation path carries a state and an
  expiry.** `proved` · `simulated` · `stale` · `untested` · `unprovable` — with
  the date it was executed, and both clocks that end it: an interval with its
  reason, and the named surface whose change voids it immediately. **Only
  execution upgrades a state**; a dry run reaches `simulated`, never `proved`.
  `stale` and `untested` are both `UNVERIFIED` (`_operation/EXPIRY.md`)
